# SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS
1. Importing Libraries pandas, numpy → Data manipulation matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn → Data visualization TfidfVectorizer → Text vectorization for machine learning WordCloud → Creating word clouds from text nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) → Used for text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)

2. Loading the Dataset

3. Sentiment Classification

Convert sentiment scores (1–5) into binary labels (negative vs. positive). Remove stopwords from text data. Convert text reviews into TF-IDF vectors for analysis.

4.Word Cloud Visualization It generates a word cloud to show the most common words in negative sentiment reviews.

5. Text Vectorization using TF-IDF Converts text data into numerical features for machine learning
  
7. Split the data into train and test

Import the model and check the accuracy score.

The accuracy of LogisticRegression Model is 0.816
